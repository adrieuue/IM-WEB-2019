			A response to Olia Lialina's 
			<a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user"> Turing Complete User </a>
			</h4>

		<p>
		<em> 1.	What do you think is Lialina’s opinion of the word “user”? </em>
		</p>

		<p>
		I think that Liliana sees the word “user” as necessary because it maintains the integrity of the interaction between people and the computer. The word allows for the implications that the computer is there for people to actually use — it doesn’t have to be a fully programmed one-way street; people can provide their own input too.
		</p>
 
 		<p>
		<em> 2.	What is Lialina’s ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines. </em>
		</p>

		<p>
		Liliana’s ideal internet user is one who can use web resources for any purpose they wish to use it for. Qualities she outlines include: effectively using any app to complete their goals (even if the goal is not what the specific app is intended for), not completely relying on the computer for some tasks, having the sense to pick and choose their way through the available resources, and approaching the computer with the mindset of having a symbiotic relationship. 
		</p>

		<p>
		<em> 3.	From your own experiences interacting on the web – what is an example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users”? </em>
		</p>

		<p>
		I am not sure if the website still operates the same way, but at least several years ago, the website Tumblr, gave users the freedom to design their own themes for their blogs. There were default themes provided and promoted by Tumblr where basic elements like colour and font size and the position of posts are decided by the user. But there were also many people who created and shared themes that they coded themselves. This allowed for a wide variety of blogs. There were strict grid layouts for photography blogs, animated custom cursors, embedded music players, personalized navigation menus, and many more. People designed or found the themes and elements that fit their own needs and their own blogs.
