		<em> 1.	Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer. </em>
		</p>

		<p>
		Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because she believes it to be the more beneficial option for the web and for the individual users. She says that despite being seemingly “accommodating and convenient to their users,” the main focus of social media giants isn’t actually the users; it’s advertising. In contrast, individual websites allow users to be top priority, because they are created by the user themselves. The website becomes a digital blank page that offers endless possibilities. Individuals can curate every detail to their liking, to support their intention, to emphasize their message, and/or to explore their ideas. Creating the website can also be creatively fulfilling for the user and build a symbiotic relationship between website and user since the web becomes another medium, and the users’ practice in the web can inform and inspire their other work. Individual websites will also lead to a more vibrant future for the web because it means more unique and interesting nodes within the connected web. Currently, the majority of websites are very cookie-cutter because it’s all “powered by a small handful of big corporations”. Schwulst mentions that websites are living, so it makes sense that she advocates for individual websites. Because like nature, diversity is essential for sustainability.

		And I agree. To a certain point. I see a lot of merit in the ambition for a more individually driven web. And I do think that social media corporations are more insistent on selling to than catering to people. However, I do think that an urge for individual websites over social media can actually be isolating and alienating to people who don’t have the time, tools, or capabilities to create their own websites. I think that presently, people have become reliant on social media because of its ease, which is the exact thing that I think helped them connect to other people in the first place. And taking that ease away for a move towards individual websites may drive a lot of people away. Which is counterproductive to the goal of worldwide connection. If the argument is that “it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us,” then I think there needs to be an acceptance of and compromise between the current ubiquity of convenience and the future necessity for divergence.
