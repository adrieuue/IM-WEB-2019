	<h1> WEBSITE AS NEEDLE AND THREAD </h1>

	<p id="one"> Websites create lines: invisible paths through interaction. </p>

	<p id="two"> Sometimes those paths stitch things together. </p>

	<p id="three"> Sometimes thereâ€™s mistakes and errors, </p>

	<p id="four"> and people have to go backwards. </p>

	<p id="five"> Sometimes, they create interesting patterns or beautiful images. </p>

	<p id="six"> Sometimes, they create a motion that people can get lost in, </p>

	<p id="seven"> weaves them through the web, </p>

	<p id="eight"> leading them forwards and backwards and over and under </p>

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"> to unexpected places and outcomes. </a>
