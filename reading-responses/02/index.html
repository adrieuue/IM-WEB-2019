			READING RESPONSE 2

			<h2>
			A response to Mindy Seu's 
			<a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools"> The Poetry of Tools </a>
			</h2>

		<em> 1.	In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader, to join her to ‘defamiliarize our tools’. What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word ‘poetry’? </em>
		</p>

		<p>
		I think what Seu means by ‘defamiliarize our tools’ is to look and think of digital tools in ways other than practicality. To see them as if they’re strange things that we never learned to use, and experiment to see what they’re capable of through exploration, rather than being told what they can do. I think this action relates to her use of the word ‘poetry’ because poetry usually delineates something expressive; and to ‘defamiliarize our tools’ moves away from being practical towards something artistic. Also, poetry often gives the viewer a thinking point, insight, and a shift in perspective. All things that that the action of ‘defamiliarizing our tools’ can achieve.

		<em> 2.	Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, and Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why. </em>

		One of Seu’s categories is “Performing Data”. This category is about visually communicating data in a form that is easier to digest than the standard linear arrangement. Looking to the name of the category, it pushes the data to perform. So rather than being something that can usually be glazed over, the performative display of information demands attention from the viewers. The expressive form can also elicit emotion, evaluation, motivation, and interpretation from the audience that could otherwise remain dormant when faced with the monotony of spreadsheets.

		A website that operates within this category is Bear 71. This is an interactive presentation of data collected on woodland creatures, such as the titular bear labelled with the number 71. The data includes information such as animal number, species, weight, age, “times spotted at campground”, and video footage. The website progresses as a narrated account of the bear’s life as the viewer navigates a 3D map of the wooded area. The website builds a world for the data to inhabit, which viewers can then explore.
